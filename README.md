## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Hi, I'm Laura
I approach everything I do with focus, curiosity, and a strong commitment to follow-through.  
My foundation began with 6 years of military service as a data processor,
where I learned discipline, precision, and how to handle complex systems under pressure.  
Since then, I graduated from UC Davis with a degree in Environmental Studies
and built a career in urban planning and e-commerce data operations
â€”always drawn to roles where structure, clarity, and meaningful outcomes matter.  
In 2024, I earned my Tableau certification, adding strong data visualization to my toolkit.  
Iâ€™m the kind of teammate who listens first, solves thoughtfully, and always follows through.  
I work with clarity, ask good questions, and take pride in getting the details rightâ€”whether itâ€™s a SQL query or a client handoff.  
Iâ€™m here to build with intention and show up with consistency.
